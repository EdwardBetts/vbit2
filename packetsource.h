/**
 * Anything that generates teletext packets is derived from this interface.
 * Functions defined by this interface are
 * Constructor - sets up the data required by a particular packet source.
 * GetPacket - Gets the next packet in the stream.
 * Waiting - The stream is waiting for an event to restart it
 * SetEvent - Registers an even with the packet source
 *
 * Teletext packets come in four broad categories
 * 1) Magazines - Rows consisting of headers and body rows.
 * 2) Subtitles - Same as magazines but sent at highest priority.
 * 3) Packets on magazine 8, row 30 - Timing and control that happen on specific fields.
 * 4) Databroadcast - Packets that get sent at low priority and when possible.
 *
 * Events
 * 1) Field
 * 2) 10 fields
 * 3) Subtitle data in buffer
 * 4) All other streams are waiting (so we can now send databroadcast)

/** @brief Events are used to trigger packet sources so that they may proceed
 *  @description Different packet sources use different timing schemes.
 *  Packet sources may put themselves into a waiting state.
 *  Events are used to start them up again.
 *  Magazines stop after a header and wait for the next field.
 *  Subtitles wait until there is data in the subtitle buffer.
 *  Packet 830 waits for a multiple of 10 fields.
 *  Databroadcast varies according to the importance of the signal.
 *  Lowest priority may only jump in only when a filler packet would be sent.
 *  Highest priority might steal all the packets except for 830.
